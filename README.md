# Pathfinding Visualizer

**Pathfinding Visualizer** is an interactive web application designed to visually demonstrate various pathfinding and maze generation algorithms. Explore and understand how these algorithms work in real-time, making it perfect for students, developers, and enthusiasts who want to learn more about graph traversal and pathfinding techniques.

## Features

### Pathfinding Algorithms:

- **A\*** (A-Star): Finds the shortest path using heuristics.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: The classic shortest-path algorithm.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores nodes layer by layer.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

### Maze Generation Algorithms:

- **Binary Search**: Generates a simple maze using binary space partitioning.
- **Recursive Division**: Creates complex mazes by recursively dividing the grid into sections.

### Additional Features:

- Interactive grid to set start and end points.
- Visual representation of algorithm execution.
- Option to adjust speed and grid size.
- Real-time updates with smooth animations.
